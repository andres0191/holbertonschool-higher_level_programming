Testdriven development.

Software-guided development, or Test-based development (TDD) is a software engineering practice that involves other practices: Write the tests first (First development test) and Refactoring (Refactoring). Unit tests are generally used to write the tests. First, a test is written and it is verified that the new test fails. Next, the code that makes the test pass satisfactorily is implemented and then the written code is refactored. The purpose of test-driven development is to achieve a clean code that works. The idea is that the requirements are translated into tests, thus, when the tests pass they specify that the software meets the requirements that have been established.
